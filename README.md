## Classes
There are a total of three subclasses implemented, each with their own special abilities and attributes.
### Rogue
> A master of disguise and distraction. Has less health than your typical character, but has a higher chance of fleeing.
#### Special Ability: Distract
Increase your chance of fleeing on use! *Can backfire and lose your turn.*
### Wizard
> A master of divination and rejuvenation. Has less health than Rogue, but deals a little more damage.
#### Special Ability: Heal
Heal yourself up to 1/2 your total health, without backfire.
### Fighter
> A master of blades and devastating blows. Deals more damage.
#### Special Ability: Empower
Concentrate, and boost your damage. *Can backfire and lose your turn.*
## Combat
Each player has a turn in a back-and-forth sequence. A menu of actions will be displayed, and you must type the name of the action into the terminal to complete that action. *(Fear not! If you mistype, it will not skip your turn.)*
A successful flee will end combat entirely, else it will end when one player reaches 0 health and dies.
